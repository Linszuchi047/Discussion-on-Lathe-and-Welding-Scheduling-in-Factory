## ‚≠êCase introduction - bicycle parts lathe and welding process

### 1. Research background

- **Welding process**
1. There are **four** different materials (**titanium, white iron, aluminum, iron**) for processing.
2. **Titanium, white iron** /**aluminum, and iron** share production capacity respectively (600 minutes of processing time each day).
3. The frame (divided into front and rear ), the front must be processed first and then the rear.
4. Different parts have different welding times.
5. Assume that there are only two welding machines for operation, respectively **welding titanium, white iron** /**aluminum, and iron.**
6. Multiple parts **cannot** be welded on the same machine at the same time.
